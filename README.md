Steps to create your first github page. 

1. Open github.com page on a browser. Click on "Sign in" on the right top if you have an account, otherwise click on "sign up" to create an account. Sign in to the account.

2. Create a new repository by clicking "new" on the left top of the screen once you login. You can also create a new repository by clicking on your Account icon on the right top of the screen and then clicking on "Your repositories" followed by "New"\

3. The repository name must start with the same username you used on your account followed by github.io. Example - username.github.io. Note - If the user name is different than the username on the account, the published page URL changes. Keep other options default and click on "Create repository"

4. You will see an option to upload the files under "quick setup", click on it.

5. Keeping the page open, open the file explorer on your desktop. 

6. Create a new folder with name username.github.io.

7. Add a photo file with your image for your portfolio. Let's name it "photofile"

8. Create a new file and name it as "index.html" and below contents. Update "username" with your git hub username and save the file.
```
<html>
    <h1>
        username's Portfolio
    </h1>
    <img src="photofile.jpg" /> 
</html>
```
9. Drag and drop the two files - photofile and index.html to the browser page you have open in step 4. Click on "commit" once you see both the file names listed on the page.
10. Congratulations, you have successfully created your first web page - https://username.github.io (Note - replace username with the git hub username)
